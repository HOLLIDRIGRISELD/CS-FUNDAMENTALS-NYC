#Given the dictionary in the student_dict.py file, representing students and the
#list of each studentâ€™s grades, find the average of each student and then print students with an
#average lower than 40. The key is the id of each student.

#dictionary from the student_dict.py at:
#https://github.com/gprok-esc-courses/cs-fundamentals/blob/main/99-csv-files/student_dict.py
